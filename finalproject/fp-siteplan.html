        <h3>Site Purpose</h3>
        <p>
          Do you believe that the right pictures help elevate the ambiance of a
          home or business? Do you have time to sort through hundreds if not
          thousands of pictures to find the right pictures for your home or
          business? If you could hire a photographer to go take the pictures
          that you wanted for a fare, price, would you be interested? My website
          will show examples of what you could get for your home or business. So
          many people sell pictures. How many people sell you the pictures you
          want? Get what you want with my website. <br />

          Why / What We Offer / How it Works <br />
          On this site, customers will see amazing pictures that inspire. They
          will be able to view a few different examples of offices that have
          incorporated the artwork in their offices to set a mood and help
          people feel more comfortable. Too many people get complacent in their
          boring spaces. Too many people get stuck and do not know how to
          change. Photography allows the viewer to feel. It can help uplift and
          inspire. Let my pictures help you. We are alive. We are here to
          experience more than the boring walls of or homes and offices.
          Experience the scenes and faces of the world. <br />
          We offer location specific photography sessions. Choose your theme. Do
          you want landscape, portrait, people, cityscape, wildlife or object?
          Do you want seasonal themes? We will get you what you want. <br />
          How it works is, we will sit down and come up with a plan. You will
          tell me what you want and I will tell you how I will do it. If you are
          unsure, I will show you examples of my work and try to get a plan.
